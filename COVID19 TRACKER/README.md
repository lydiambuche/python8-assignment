# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 Global Data Tracker is a comprehensive data analysis project that tracks global trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The project leverages real-world datasets to provide insights through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualizations.

## Features

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data from reliable sources.
- Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across multiple countries.
- Visualize data using line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and choropleth maps.
- Generate a well-documented Jupyter Notebook report combining code, visuals, and narrative insights.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modular Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**: Loading datasets and initial exploration.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filtering and preparing data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and trend analysis.
4. **Vaccination Visualization**: Analysis of vaccination rollout progress.
5. **Choropleth Map Visualization**: Geographic visualization of cases and vaccinations.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly (for interactive choropleth maps)

## Testing

Each notebook has an associated test script to verify its functionality and correctness. The tests cover data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.

## How to Run

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```
2. Run each Jupyter notebook in sequence to reproduce the analysis.
3. Optionally, run the test scripts to verify each step.

## Final Deliverable

A reproducible and well-documented data analysis report that provides insights into global COVID-19 trends, suitable for presentation or publication.
